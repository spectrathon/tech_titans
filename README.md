## About the Project

Current security systems often rely on CCTV footage with blurry or low-quality number plates, hindering investigations and identification of vehicles involved in incident. Our project aims to develop a software tool that analyzes pre-recorded video footage stored on DVRs (Digital Video Recorders).

Our project takes a video footage as the input and performs the following features to help detect the vehicle and provide a detailed report as the output which include information such as:

<ul>
    <li>Number Plate Detection and Enhancement</li>
    <li>Character Recognition using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</li>
    <li>Vehicle Recognition</li>
    <li>Anomaly Detection</li>
    <li>Automatic Report Generation</li>
    <li>Integration with External Databases</li>
</ul>
